Compiler Design

This project aims to provide a new compiler for Mini C  language that is a subset of C language. A compiler is a set code that convert high level program (here C program) to assembly level program or machine level program (binary code). In this project, we try to build a Mini C Compiler For Testing and implementing simple arithmetic instructions involving integers as operands. The code converts a subset of 'C' language to assembly language. It also spots syntactic errors. We intend to build a compiler which has efficient memory utilization and more compile time efficiency.
